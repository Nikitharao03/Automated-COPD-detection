# Automated-COPD-detection
Data Collection: Gather labeled CT scan datasets of patients with and without COPD.
Data Preprocessing: Normalize CT images, segment lungs, and enhance relevant features.
Model Selection: Use Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to analyze and classify CT scan images.
Training and Validation: Train the CNN on the labeled dataset and validate using a separate validation set.
Evaluation: Assess model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC.
